<h1>Assignment 0 - Finding Syntax Errors</h1>
<p>
You hand in this assignment by showing it to the lecturer when
it is completed. This assignment contains some syntax errors you
should correct and it works well when you can run it without an
error message been displayed and the 10 randomly chosen numbers
analyzed correctly.

    Most of a web page is written in
    <a href="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/Learning/HTML/Ref/">Hypertext
    Markup Language (HTML)</a>. But this page contains also some parts in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. Note that
    there is an other programming language with the name Java, but JavaScript
    shares with it just the name. These parts are mixed into the HTML page. In
    order to make it easier for you to learn to program with JavaScript, you
    receive almost ready programs. So you do not need to learn HTML.

    <div>Task of this exercise</div>
    <p>
    This exercise is quite easy. Its main task is to teach you to find typing
    errors in a program, this process is called debugging. The given program
    has errors in seven lines and you should find and correct them all; some of
    the faulty statements are superfluous and can be deleted, others have to be
    corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your web browser provides help for finding JavaScript bugs. You have two
    browsers available in the lab: Mozilla Firefox 24 and Internet Explorer 7.
    We recommend you to choose Firefox, as it strongly adheres to web standards
    and its version is quite up-to-date, unlike Internet Explorer. However
    instructions are given for both.
    </p>

        <div>Firefox</div>
        <p>
        Since 2013, Firefox is installed with a complete set of tools for web
        development purposes. You can enable these tools it for a given page
        from <q>Tools</q>, <q>Web Developer</q>, <q>Toggle Tools</q>
        (or Ctrl+Shift+I on your keyboard). The main tool you will be using at
        first is the <q>Console</q> one. You can restrict the sources to only JS
        by clicking (and disabling) the other tags (Net, CSS, Security, Logging).

        <p>
        Having done this, you should on the one hand edit the file with the text
        of this page and on the other hand press the <q>Reload Current Page</q>
        button of the browser to see the effect of what you are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
        It also provides you with an inline JavaScript interpreter so you
        can type some code and immediately see the results.

        <p>
        These explanations have been verified for Internet Explorer version 7
        only, upper versions might have a different layout and/or behaviour. You
        have to change the default settings:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            Go to the menu <q>Tools</q> and then to the last row <q>Internet
            Options</q>.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new window titled <q>Internet Options</q> pops up. Go to the
            <q>Advanced</q> entry in the list of subwindows on the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check the <q>Display a notification about every script error</q> box
            (sixth box under the <q>Browsing</q> entry).
        </li>
        <li>Press <q>OK</q> in the lowest row to finish.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Having done this, you should on the one hand edit the file with the text
        of this page and on the other hand press the <q>refresh</q> or
        <q>reloading</q> button of the browser to see the effect of what you are
        doing. Note that you should view the details of the announced JavaScript
        errors to get the line numbers.
        </p>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    <div>What the correct program does</div>
    <p>
    The corrected program computes the divisors of 10 randomly chosen numbers
    between 1 and 99 and then checks whether the chosen number is prime, square
    or having only one decimal digit. The number and the diagnosis about it are
    printed out.
