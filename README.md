## Project Details

### Project 1: UNIBUDS | Orbital
- Description: This is my first mobile application project. I am using Node.js, React Native, and Supabase. Expo is also being used for temporary deployment (because listing the app on App Store for iOS requires money!)
- [Live Demo] | [GitHub Repository](Both Temporarily private ;))

### Project 2: The A-maze-ing Race | Maze-solving Robot
- Description: The "The A-maze-ing Race" project involved a maze which required us to create a robot which can solve through the maze in the shortest amount of time. Along the maze, various pieces of coloured paper instruct our robot react accordingly in order to complete the race. The colours help determine which direction the robot has to move in through the maze at a particular way point.

### Project 3: Obstacle Course Robot
- Description: Created a robot that is powered by a 9.0V battery and must navigate through an obstacle course with a slope and bump. The robot must then stop 5 cm away from a wall and deliver a ping pong ball over it.
